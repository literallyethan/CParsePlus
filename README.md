# CParsePlus
A parsing library that allows extreme flexibility with where to send info and how from a file.
(Scope and features likely to creep extremely.)

Project Description:
    To be able to read from a file (txt at least) and parse information out of it
    into containers specified by the user.

Starting Point:
    Take a given struct and file, and place the contents of the file into the 
    proper variable types of the struct.

Stretch Goals:
    - Work with classes as well as structs
    - Work with more text-based file types like pdf

Structure:
    Start with a small header file make submodules when scope begins to creep.
